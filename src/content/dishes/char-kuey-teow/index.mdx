Char Kuey Teow translates to stir fried rice noodles. It can be thought of as one
of, if not the definitive dishes of Penang, Malaysia. Locals believe that while you
can find good Char Kuey Teow throughout Malaysia, if you want great Char Kuey Teow
you must travel to Penang.

While there is nothing terribly complicated about Char Kuey Teow at first glance, don't get fooled by thinking this is a simple dish to make well at home. The best Char Kuey Teow, like all of the best hawker and street fare, and food in general throughout Asia, is made by vendors who have mastered their craft, making this one single dish perhaps hundreds of times a day over decades and decades, and eventually lifetimes.

Being a stir fry, nailing the timing on when to add ingredients is key. Sourcing quality ingredients is, as always, also key. Replicating the fleeting wok hei of a perfect stir fry by a master of thei craft over extremely high heat is close to impossible at home. That doesn't stop me from trying, and neither should it stop you. It's still possible to make a good char kuey teow at home.

## Notes

### On Achieving Wok Hei

Achiving wok hei is part art, part magic, and generally beyond the scope of this post. But basic stir fry principles apply. Don't overcrowd the wok. Don't add too much wet ingredients at once. Get the highest heat source you can. The rest, dear friend, is up to you. The dish will still taste good when cooked at home on a regular stove. It just won't have that magical breath of the wok.

### On Hitting the Flavor Profile

In Malaysia, almost all versions of this dish are made with blood cockle. Love it or hate it, it gives a strong sea flavor dimension on top of the shrimp. Here in the northeast USA, I'll someday try subsituting some steamer clams. Either way, if you can't find blood cockles, and you probably can't, at least don't skip the shrimp. And don't substitute the shrimp for another meat protein. To my knowlede that just isn't a thing.

### The Magic of Penang

The versions in Penang are lighter in color than the more dark soy sauce drenched kinds found elsewhere.

Oh, the cubed variety
